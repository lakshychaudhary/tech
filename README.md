# tech

Many times my friends ask me to explain technical concepts as I am a Software Engineering Student.
What I do is I donâ€™t use much jargon and try to explain in easy words and try to relate it to their profession. I make it easy by giving real-life examples.
For example,
If I have to explain Object Oriented Programming to a friend who is an Automobile Engineer, I will relate the car to an object. The color of the car is an attribute. The speed is the method(function).
If I have to explain about Blockchain technology to a friend who is a CA, I will relate it to a ledger and explain.
